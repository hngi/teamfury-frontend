## Getting Started

The Frontend team has been sectioned into subgroups, with each subgroup expected to work on a design. As this is would be a group project, I suggest we check the guide on [GitHub projects](). Each subgroup's lead are:

- Group 1 - @chimdia | github - @chimidiya1
- Group 3 - @dpkreativ | github - @dpkreativ
- Group 2 - @Gordie | github - @Xodtuza
- Group 5 - @cj1996 | github - @chiaka1996
- Group 4 - @victorAnumudu | github - @victorAnumudu

All team leads must update their progress on their README on their different branches.

If you don't have a team already, i suggest you reach out any of them to show your interest in becoming a member of that team. The team leads are to coordinate the activities of the group, so as to come out with a good implementation of the designs.they are to ensure:

- Consistency of thier work with the design template
- Mobile readiness
- Cross Browser Compatibility
- Ease of Customizablility
- Use of high quality assets
